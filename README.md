# Shopify App Template for Node

This is a template for building a [Shopify app](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/getting-started) using Node and React. It contains the basics for building a Shopify app.

## Benefits

Shopify apps are built on a variety of Shopify tools to create a great merchant experience.
The Node app template comes with the following out-of-the-box functionality:

- OAuth: Installing the app and granting permissions
- GraphQL Admin API: Querying or mutating Shopify admin data
- REST Admin API: Resource classes to interact with the API
- Shopify-specific tooling:
  - AppBridge
  - Polaris
  - Webhooks

## Getting started

### Requirements

1. You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it.
1. You must [create a Shopify partner account](https://partners.shopify.com/signup) if you don’t have one.
1. You must create a store for testing if you don't have one, either a [development store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/development-stores#create-a-development-store) or a [Shopify Plus sandbox store](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/dashboard/managing-stores/plus-sandbox-store).

### Installing the template

This template can be installed using your preferred package manager:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn create @shopify/app --template=node
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm init @shopify/app@latest -- --template=node
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm create @shopify/app@latest --template=node
```

This will clone the template and install the required dependencies.

#### Local Development

[The Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli) connects to an app in your Partners dashboard. It provides environment variables, runs commands in parallel, and updates application URLs for easier development.

You can develop locally using your preferred package manager. Run one of the following commands from the root of your app.

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open the URL generated in your console. Once you grant permission to the app, you can start development.

## Deployment

### Application Storage

This template uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) to store session data. The database is a file called `database.sqlite` which is automatically created in the root. This use of SQLite works in production if your app runs as a single instance.

### Build

The frontend is a single page app. It requires the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, which you can find on the page for your app in your partners dashboard. Paste your app’s key in the command for the package manager of your choice:

Using yarn:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME yarn build
```

Using npm:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME npm run build
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
cd web/frontend/ && SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME pnpm run build
```

You do not need to build the backend.

## Hosting

When you're ready to set up your app in production, you can follow [our deployment documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web) to host your app on a cloud provider like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/).

When you reach the step for [setting up environment variables](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/deployment/web#set-env-vars), you also need to set the variable `NODE_ENV=production`.

## Tech Stack

This template combines a number of third party open-source tools:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) builds the backend.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) builds the [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is used for routing. We wrap this with file-based routing.
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) queries the Admin API.
- [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) and related libraries are used to internationalize the frontend.
  - [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/) is used for React-specific i18n functionality.
  - [`i18next-resources-to-backend`](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-resources-to-backend) is used to dynamically load app translations.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-localematcher`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-localematcher/) is used to match the user locale with supported app locales.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-locale`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-locale) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.Locale`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale) if necessary.
  - [`@formatjs/intl-pluralrules`](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-pluralrules) is used as a polyfill for [`Intl.PluralRules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules) if necessary.

The following Shopify tools complement these third-party tools to ease app development:

- [Shopify API library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) adds OAuth to the Express backend. This lets users install the app and grant scope permissions.
- [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started/using-react) adds authentication to API requests in the frontend and renders components outside of the App’s iFrame.
- [Polaris React](https://polaris.shopify.com/) is a powerful design system and component library that helps developers build high quality, consistent experiences for Shopify merchants.
- [Custom hooks](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/tree/main/hooks) make authenticated requests to the Admin API.
- [File-based routing](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-frontend-template-react/blob/main/Routes.jsx) makes creating new pages easier.
- [`@shopify/i18next-shopify`](https://github.com/Shopify/i18next-shopify) is a plugin for [`i18next`](https://www.i18next.com/) that allows translation files to follow the same JSON schema used by Shopify [app extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/best-practices/localizing-ui-extensions#how-it-works) and [themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture/locales/storefront-locale-files#usage).
